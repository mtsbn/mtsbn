  I currently work as Backend Developer at Stone. I'm work with .Net and Sql Server, but sometimes I venture into FrontEnd too (React).
  In my free time I like to study a little bit of Internet of things and seek new things to learn. 
  At the moment I'm trying to delve more into what I already know, and understand more about code tests
